# python_projects

Learning progress overview:

_Week 1-2_: Learned about data types, data structures, conditional statements and loops. Learned how to manipulate the data structures with data
>> * Data Types/Variables: String, Integer, Float, Boolean 
>> * Data Structures: List/Array, Dictionary, Tuples, and Sets
>> * Overall pretty basic concepts. I took a python and database course in college so a lot of this was just a refresher for me. 

_Week 3-4_: Learned function arguments, namespace/scope, object-oriented programming (class structure) and unit testing 
>> * function arguments were really easy to grasp 
>> * namespace and scope took longer to wrap my head around it. This became easier and more straightforward after working with Classes more often 
>> * Object Oriented programming was also a bit difficult to grasp at first with the introduction of Classes. Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism made sense, in an of themselves, but I was struggled to understand the appropriate application at times. 
>> * Classes felt really odd to use at first, but their value became more apparent the more I exposed myself to the syntax and completed a coding interview exercies that could easilt leverage the functions of a class and more modular code 
>> * Unit testing is difficult. Still struggle to grasp the concepts and throwing exceptions. In a production environment, when going over the PRDs with a product manager at the start of a sprint, I believe unit testing will make more sense in the scope of a project and the specific stop gap's extrapolated from the requirments of the code functionality.
